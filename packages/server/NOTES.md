# Notes to self

- 27 August 2019: put prettier and its dependencies at the root of the project to make git commit hooks work. Not sure why.
- 30 August 2019: not restoring jest mocks is a memory leak.
- 1 September 2019: [Faker][github-faker] has a memory leak use [Casual][github-casual] instead.
- 1 September 2019: Nunjucks seems to have a memory leak - what are the alternatives?
