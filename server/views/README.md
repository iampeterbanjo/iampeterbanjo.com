Rendere API data as views using templates

## Note

- Using [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) has a memory leak which is reported by lab - "The following leaks were detected:__core-js_shared__". This is possibly related to [this issue](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/2972) therefore using [Ejs](https://www.ejs.co/) instead.
